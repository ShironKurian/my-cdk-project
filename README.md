My AWS CDK Project
This is an AWS CDK project that automates the deployment of AWS infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. The project is integrated with GitHub and AWS CodePipeline to enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of your AWS resources.

Project Overview
This project uses the AWS CDK to define AWS resources in a TypeScript or Python application, and deploys them through AWS CloudFormation. The goal is to automate the provisioning of infrastructure using code.
Key components of this project:
•	GitHub as the source code repository.
•	AWS CodePipeline to manage the CI/CD process.
•	AWS CodeBuild for building and testing the project.
•	AWS CloudFormation for deployment.
Technologies Used
•	AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK): Defines cloud infrastructure using code.
•	AWS CodePipeline: Automates the CI/CD pipeline.
•	AWS CodeBuild: Automates the build process.
•	AWS CloudFormation: Provisions AWS resources.
•	GitHub: Source code repository.
Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you need the following tools installed on your local machine:
1.	Node.js (for CDK)
o	Install it from Node.js website.
2.	AWS CLI (for interacting with AWS services)
o	Install it from AWS CLI documentation.
3.	AWS CDK CLI (for deploying CDK applications)
o	Install it globally with: 
npm install -g aws-cdk
4.	Git (for version control)
o	Install it from Git website.
5.	A GitHub account (to store your source code repository).
6.	AWS Account (for deploying resources).
Setup Instructions
1.	Clone the Repository
o	Clone this repository to your local machine: 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-cdk-project.git
cd my-cdk-project
2.	Install Dependencies
o	Run the following command to install the required npm dependencies: 
npm install
3.	Configure AWS CLI
o	Make sure your AWS CLI is configured with the correct credentials: 
aws configure
o	Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, Region, and Output format.
4.	Deploy Using CDK
o	To deploy the AWS infrastructure defined in this project, use the following CDK command: 
cdk deploy
o	This command will deploy the stack and all resources to AWS.
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
The project is configured to automatically deploy whenever changes are made to the source code. This is done by setting up a CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline.
Steps:
1.	Source Stage:
o	GitHub is configured as the source provider. CodePipeline will listen for changes in the main branch of your GitHub repository.
2.	Build Stage:
o	AWS CodeBuild is used to run a build process that installs dependencies and synthesizes the CDK application using the buildspec.yml file.
3.	Deploy Stage:
o	AWS CloudFormation deploys the synthesized CloudFormation template to provision AWS resources.
Deploying the Stack
1.	Push Changes to GitHub:
o	Make sure that all changes are committed to GitHub.
o	Example commands: 
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push origin main
2.	CodePipeline Execution:
o	When you push changes to the main branch, AWS CodePipeline will automatically trigger the pipeline.
o	The pipeline will run AWS CodeBuild to build the application and then deploy the stack using AWS CloudFormation.
3.	Monitor the Pipeline:
o	You can monitor the pipeline execution in the AWS CodePipeline Console.

Troubleshooting
•	If the pipeline doesn't start after pushing changes, ensure that: 
o	The GitHub repository and CodePipeline are correctly connected.
o	The correct branch is selected in the source stage.
•	If the buildspec.yml file is missing in the artifact, ensure that: 
o	The file is located in the root directory of the repository.
o	The repository is correctly connected in the source stage of CodePipeline.
